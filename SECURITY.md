# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes target the latest released version and the current default branch. Older revisions may require updating before a fix can be applied.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for an unpatched vulnerability. Use the repository's **Security** tab to open a private security advisory and include:

- the affected version or commit;
- the attacker prerequisites and expected impact;
- reproducible steps or a minimal proof of concept;
- any suggested remediation;
- whether the issue affects existing data, backups, sessions, or new-device sign-in.

Please avoid accessing data that is not yours, degrading a production service, or publishing details before a fix is available. Acknowledgement and remediation timing depend on severity and reproducibility.

## Security boundaries

Inkstone is self-hosted software, not a hosted service. Deployment owners are responsible for their NAS, network exposure, access policies, backup destinations, and timely updates. Inkstone does not provide a password-reset bypass; losing the owner password requires restoring from a trusted backup or reinitializing the instance.
